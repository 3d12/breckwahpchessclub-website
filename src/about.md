Breckenridge-Wahpeton Chess Club is a gathering of players from the twin towns area of the southern Red River valley, who like to gather together to share their love of the game of chess!

Currently, the club meets at the **Breckenridge Public Library** on the **1st and 3rd Tuesdays** of each month. (205 7th St N, Breckenridge, MN 56520)
* The 1st Tuesday of each month we discuss tactics or dive into game review and analysis
* The 3rd Tuesday of each month is a free-to-enter swiss-style G/15 tournament, with individual prizes and a cumulative ranking system which encourages participation throughout the year

The club is hosted by Breckenridge Wahpeton Chess, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded and managed by Dominik Rauber.
