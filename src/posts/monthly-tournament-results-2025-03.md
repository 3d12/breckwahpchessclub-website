Zoom! This month's games went by in a flash, since there were only **5 minutes** assigned for each player! We saw some very exciting games in this blitz format though; everything from very early checkmates, to nail-biting last-second finishes!

It's also really great to see new people attending our tournaments. The positive atmosphere our club brings to these events is amazing, and I think a major part of that is our club members who are willing to be patient with newcomers and help teach them concepts both during and after the game.

So I want to say, thank you to everyone for attending, but a special thank you goes to anyone who played against someone new to the club and spent time helping them to learn! You are what makes our club awesome!

Since we played twice as many games as normal for this tournament, we are going to cut the point values here in half (rounded up to the nearest half-point) for adding to the ongoing 2025 standings. So if you see your score on the [standings page](/standings) for this month and it looks different than what's in the table below, that's why.

As always, if you have any questions about any of the standings, or ideas for future monthly tournaments or other events, please [reach out!](mailto:breckwahpchess@gmail.com) We love to hear from our community. If you're part of the club on chess.com you can post to the [club forums](https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/wahpeton-breckenridge-chess-club), or if you're on Facebook you can reach us via our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/people/Breckenridge-Wahpeton-Chess/61554099290457/)!

Thanks, everyone! See you next time!
