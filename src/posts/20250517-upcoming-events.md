Hi folks!

Another school year in the books! This year, we helped host clubs and tournaments at both Wahpeton Elementary and Middle schools, and the tournaments especially turned out very exciting. I'm incredibly proud of how far all of our students have come in their chess journey.

Speaking of journeys, what's next for the club? Well, just like last summer, we have our eye on a few different events...

First of all, just like last year, **Chess in the Park** is off to a windy start! Today is the first official day of the event, but this is an event held **every Saturday, 10:30am-1pm in Chahinkapa Park**. If you've been in the park and haven't seen us, don't worry! We're working on getting some signage so it will be easier to find us, but usually we're on the trail that cuts through the park by Hughes Shelter, like today:

Just a reminder, this event is "weather permitting," so modifications and cancellations can and will happen. Fortunately, this year we have our [events calendar](/calendar) so we can communicate these changes near-instantaneously. If you want to stay up-to-date with chess events happening in your local area, please consider subscribing to our calendar!

Next, and coming up very soon, we have our **Blue Goose Days Tournament** on **Saturday June 7th, from 11am-5:30pm at Hughes Shelter in Chahinkapa Park**. This is one of our two capstone events each year, with large cash prizes for top overall placements, and prize brackets for participants under-18 and under-12.

If you haven't already signed up for the Blue Goose Days Tournament, please do so by [clicking this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRi4oE1JqBu9QRMNhF66j--HJeljWGk4Ry_j6nXds_TAyC6A/viewform?usp=sharing). Payment of the entry fee is due at the event, but pre-registering your info helps us get everyone accounted for quickly at the event, so if you're planning to be there, please consider letting us know!

OK, last topic -- as you may recall, last year we participated in both Borderline Chalkfest and Headwaters Day. No official confirmation yet, but I think I can say that we're certainly considering taking part in these events again this year. More details to come, so keep an eye on this blog!

Alright, thanks everyone! Let's have some great games at this month's upcoming tournament on Tuesday, and again at Blue Goose Days!
