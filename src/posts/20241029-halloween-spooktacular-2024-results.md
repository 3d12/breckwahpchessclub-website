We had some very intense games being played, and the atmosphere in the community center was electric during the last few rounds as the anticipation grew!

To help ease the tension between rounds and provide an outlet for some energy and creative focus, tournament participants and attendees were invited to decorate a 3d-printed chess piece to take home. It was truly amazing seeing all the creativity on display! Take a look at what the drying rack looked like during our final round of tournament play:
