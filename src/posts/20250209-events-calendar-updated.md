Hi everyone! I hope you're all enjoying all this snow!

I wanted to make an announcement, that the events calendar on the website is now up-to-date with our recurring events through the end of 2025. What does this mean for you? Well, this means you can now link this calendar to your own calendar (such as Google or Apple calendar, as long as it supports the iCal format) by importing this link: ([link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/3a38541024cdd1693a059632c4b3cfd6f7b792a65d7075af8351cfc1010e117e%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)) and that way you can always keep up to date with the events going on at the club!

All the recurring events have been given a tag, here's what those mean:
  * **[Open]**: This tag means this is an event anyone can attend, so please do!
  * **[Board]**: This tag means this event is attended by members of the nonprofit organization board (the people whose faces appear on [this page](https://breckwahpchess.org/about/)) -- so if you would like to attend one of these, reach out to us!
  * **[P+]**: This tag means this event is open to Player+ (or Family) members only! Membership for the club is new for 2025, but it comes with all kinds of perks, one of them is admission to these events! Reach out to us if you're interested, we have all sorts of info we can share about it.
  * **[WES]**: This tag means this event is open only to students of Wahpeton Elementary School
  * **[WMS]**: This tag means this event is open only to students of Wahpeton Middle School

We will make updates to the events calendar as events change, or if they're affected due to weather and the like, so check back often to stay up-to-date!

Note that I've only mentioned recurring events so far... We haven't forgotten that Blue Goose Days is coming up soon! (Easy to forget though, with all this snow...)

When it comes to large tournaments and capstone events such as the Winter Chess Classic and Blue Goose Days, we will post those onto the events calendar the same day the flyers begin getting posted for the events around town. This will add to the excitement of these events when they appear, and keep everyone on the same page for when the schedules are finalized.

Speaking of upcoming tournaments, I think there might be something in the works for this Spring... Not quite as large as Blue Goose Days, but since we're getting more into the stride of hosting these tournaments, there might be something coming up to fill the time before Blue Goose Days takes over our thoughts and planning. I don't want to say too much yet, but if you haven't already joined our club on chess.com, it might be a really good idea to do that...

I think that's it for today! Thank you so much for checking in with us, as we continue to make 2025 a memorable year for the club!
