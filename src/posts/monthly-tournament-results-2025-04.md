Hello everyone, and happy Easter to all who celebrate!

We had some very exciting games this month, including a milestone for the club -- Isaac achieved his first OTB win against Dominik, and went on a crushing streak to win the entire tournament! Congratulations, Isaac! Your hard work is paying off, and your skills are developing quite quickly.

We are all working hard to develop our skills, and it's a great benefit to our club to have so many strong players. In an atmosphere where everyone is so strong, it can be difficult sometimes to find the courage to continue to compete. I asked Pastor Clark about this one of the last times we played together, and he recounted some memories of his time in track. There were so many strong runners on the team that it became incredibly difficult to set any individual records -- but seeing how the team performed as a whole, and how the strength of each runner was shared with the team, it inspires everyone to try their best. And I think that's the kind of environment we strive to foster here. You know, we may be opponents sitting across the table, but at the end of the day I'm so proud of the progress of all of our club members. Being surrounded by such strength is truly inspiring, and it really shows in the way our community engages with one another at our events.

We had another fresh entry in this tournament as well, so welcome! Just a reminder, our monthly tournaments are free to enter, and even if you don't win, there is a random drawing for a prize each month. So tell your friends!

Thanks everyone for attending and playing, and we'll see you next month!
