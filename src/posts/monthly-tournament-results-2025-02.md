Hi, folks!

With the cold weather outside, being inside and playing chess seems like a great place to be. And indeed, we had some great and exciting games last night at our monthly tournament!

Congratulations to our winner Isaac, winning all four of his games this tournament. Great job!

We hope to see you all at our next monthly tournament, hopefully by that time the weather will be much nicer!

Also a reminder for our **Player+** and **Family** members: our next meeting is this coming Monday, the 24th at 5pm. If you have a learning plan already developed, be prepared to demonstrate what you've got so far -- and if you don't have a plan set up yet, come on in and we'll get one set up for you!

Thanks everyone! See you next time!
