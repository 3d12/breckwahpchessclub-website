Thanks to everyone who participated this month! We had some very exciting games this month, and I think this tournament set a new club record for number of draws!

Below is a table showing the scores from this event, including all tiebreakers. But don't forget, you can see the ongoing standings on our [standings page](/standings), where we accumulate points from each of the monthly tournaments. At the end of the year, your **best 10 of 12** scores are totalled into your final placements, so if you missed this event or feel like you could have done better, you'll have another chance next month!
