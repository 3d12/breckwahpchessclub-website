We're all wrapped up with our first full year of monthly tournaments! A huge congratulations to all our winners, and thank you to everyone who participated in our tournaments throughout the year!

We've had some very exciting games this year, lots to look back on and lots more to look forward to!

We have our holiday party coming up this Saturday the 7th, from 4pm-7pm at the Breckenridge Family and Community Center! We hope to see you all there! In addition to celebrating the winners of our year-long tournament run, we will also be making some announcements about the club and sharing our vision for the future of the club and for the chess scene in the area!

Saturdays we are still playing at Dakota Coffee Company, we hope to see you there! Otherwise, our next regular meeting at the Breck Library will be the 17th, then we're into the new year!

Thanks for a terrific year of games, and we hope you will come with us on our journey into 2025!
