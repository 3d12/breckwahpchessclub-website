Greetings, everyone!

We're rapidly approaching Blue Goose Days, and it shows! Everyone seems to have brought their A-game to this tournament and we ended up with multiple exciting games! This all culminated in my 2nd tournament win so far, and my first tournament with a perfect record, a performance I can hope to repeat at Blue Goose Days next month... ðŸ™‚

We had two new competitors at this month's tournament, one whom we've seen before at our capstone tournaments, and one just discovering the club for the first time. It's always great to see newcomers showing up to check out the club, and one of them even won our random draw for chamber bucks, so that's some extra incentive to keep coming back!

Anyway, it was great to see so many people at this month's tournament all getting prepared for our next big tournament. Make sure that if you haven't already signed up for the tournament that you sign up soon!

Thanks everyone, and see you next time!
