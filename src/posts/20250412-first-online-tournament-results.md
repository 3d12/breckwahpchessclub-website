Hello, everyone!

In case you didn't know, we have been trying to branch out more into the online space for our club. In working towards that goal, we've hosted our first ever online tournament for the club!

You can find the final results posted below, both as an image and as a link directly to the event page.

Thank you to everyone who participated! This is a bold new step forward for the club, and one that we hope to explore in different ways in the future.

Also, don't forget that our next monthly tournament is coming up this Tuesday, April 15th! So we'll see you in person at the Breck Library for that!

One more reminder: If you're part of the school clubs at Wahpeton Middle or Elementary schools, remember that our end-of-year tournament is coming up! This is your chance to put your skills to the test against your fellow classmates, and show them what you've learned this year! There will be prizes, they might be yours! You'll have to come participate to find out, ask your librarian for dates and details.

That's all so far, but there will be another post with the results from this month's tournament coming soon. Thank you!
