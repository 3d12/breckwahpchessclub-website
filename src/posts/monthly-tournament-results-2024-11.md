Greetings!

We had such a spectacular turnout for this month's tournament, it made the room feel quite small! Seems like there were a lot of exciting games going on, which is always great to see.

Don't forget our seasonal holiday party happening Saturday December 7th! If you need more info, or would like to RSVP, please contact us and let us know! ([Email](mailto:breckwahpchess@gmail.com))

There might also be a change-up of our regular tournament schedule for December, due to the holidays. An email should be coming out with details in the next week or so, so keep your eyes peeled for info on that!

And, on the horizon, the 2025 Winter Chess Classic is coming up! Signups are not yet open, but if you have any feedback, requests, suggestions, or constructive criticism, please contact us and let us know! We're in the process of planning this event now, so please reach out if you have any feedback, so we can take it into consideration as we finalize the event.

One last reminder, Saturdays through the winter months we have open chess at Dakota Coffee Company in Wahpeton from 9:30AM-11:30AM. This event replaces Chess in the Park until the weather is more accommodating to sitting outside for hours.

Thanks, everyone! See you next time!
