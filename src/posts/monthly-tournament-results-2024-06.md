Wow! What a terrific tournament! This month we had so many strong players attending, which led to some absolutely fantastic games! This tournament was just as much a joy to watch as to participate in, and many of the games were decisive but required some very deep calculation.

We're keeping the momentum going from these recent summer tournaments, and branching out into some other events. For example: Chess in the Park! This is an outdoor event, so it's always "weather permitting," but it's a good excuse to get together in some of our beautiful local parks and enjoy some chess on Saturday mornings throughout the summer and into fall! More info and a schedule coming soon, but the next one is at [Oxcart Trail Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RDiU52hhTDGwXc1c9) this Saturday, June 22nd from 10am-1pm.

**Remember:** these monthly tournaments (3rd tuesday of each month) are always free to enter, and you can win $10 in chamber bucks for winning the tournament... or even just for showing up! One of the prizes is a random draw, so if you or a friend want to come check it out, there's no downside and you might even walk away with a prize!

Thanks everyone, see you at the next tournament!
