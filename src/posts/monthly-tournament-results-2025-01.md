Greetings, everyone!

We're well underway with preparations for the Winter Chess Classic, and we're excited to have kicked off our 2025 tournament year with a terrific tournament!

We had two amazing draws among the top players for this tournament, and it came down to a final tiebreaker to determine the winner! If this is a preview of how our year of tournaments will turn out, then I think 2025 will be an amazing year to be part of this chess community.

Hopefully we'll see all of you this Saturday at the Winter Chess Classic, over at the Breck Family and Community Center on January 25th, starting at 9:00! Be there by 8:30 to get registered early!

Thank you to all our participants this month, and good luck to all who are participating this Saturday!
