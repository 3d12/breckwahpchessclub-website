As the seasons change, the leaves change color and the air becomes colder. While this is undoubtedly beautiful, it becomes difficult to keep focus on a game when the temperature gets so cold.

Therefore, Chess in the Park has officially come to a close for the year.

**But**, this is not the end! The folks at Dakota Coffee Company in Wahpeton have graciously agreed to host us on Saturday mornings, from **9:30 to 11:30 AM** throughout the cold months!

So, come join us for coffee and chess on Saturday mornings at Dakota Coffee Company! We hope to see you there!
