Hi, everyone! As the weather gets colder, the games seem to be heating up! We've had some exceptional competition this month, and the standings were still quite uncertain, even leading into the last round of the tournament!

Even though our monthly tournaments are coming to a close for the year, we have a few more events lined up before the year ends:

First up, if you haven't already registered for the **K-12 Halloween Spooktacular**, the signup link is here: [Sign up!](https://signup.breckwahpchess.com) This tournament is open to all school-age participants, and we have prizes sponsored by Wal-Mart and the Wahpeton Breckenridge Area Chamber of Commerce that are up for grabs, so make sure you get signed up! And, entry is free if you attend in costume!

Next, we have an end-of-year celebration coming up at the Breckenridge Family and Community Center. Come join us for a winter holiday celebration Saturday, December 7th as we bring the tournament year to a close with an open-invitation **Christmas Party**! More details and a sign-up link to come, but we will be making some end-of-year announcements and laying out a roadmap for the club's future, so we hope you can join us as we prepare to step boldly into 2025!

Speaking of 2025, we are in the process of planning our 2025 Winter Chess Classic, the 2nd annual iteration of our inaugural public competition! If you attended the 2024 Winter Chess Classic and would like to provide some feedback on what you think went well, what you would like to see changed, or suggestions for prizes or content, please contact us here and let us know: [Contact Us](mailto:breckwahpchess@gmail.com)

Thanks, everyone! Stay warm!
