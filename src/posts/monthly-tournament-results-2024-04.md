More exciting chess this month! Thank you to everyone who came out to this month's tournament, we had some very close games and in the end, this month came down to the result of two tiebreakers!

Looks like things over on the [standings board](https://breckwahpchess.com/standings) are heating up between our top two competitors! But we have many more tournaments yet to play this year, and many more exciting games ahead!

Also, it looks like over on the forums, our club members have started to share their games from these monthly tournaments. If you're interested in seeing some of these games, or some of the analysis provided by other club members, please visit the [club forums on chess.com](https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/wahpeton-breckenridge-chess-club). You may need to request membership to view the forums, so if you're not yet a member of the online club, please join!

Thanks everyone! See you next month!
