With the weather warming up, and school dismissed for the year, summer is now in full swing. For most people, this means lakeside relaxation; but if you're not out at the lake, why not join us for some chess events?

First up, a new event and still gaining traction: **Chess in the Park**

Chess in the Park is a Saturday morning event taking place in a rotating location. We set up chessboards at one of our many fabulous local parks, and play chess in the great outdoors!

The 15th was very windy, and this past Saturday the 22nd got a little sprinkly, but we didn't let that discourage us from enjoying the outdoor play! Like all outdoor events though, this one is "weather permitting," so modifications and cancellations can and will happen. We're still trying to work out the best place to centralize a schedule for this event, so until otherwise noted, check back on this blog for the latest updates.

Currently, the Chess in the Park schedule is as follows:
- Saturday, June 29th: Welles Memorial Park, 10a-1p
- Saturday, July 6th: **TBD**

Moving on, our other upcoming event is **Borderline Chalkfest** ([link](https://www.wahpetonbreckenridgechamber.com/borderline-chalkfest/))

We plan to set up chessboards in the gazebo next to the Leach Library, which will be available for open play throughout the Chalkfest festivities. Keep an eye out for some chess-related chalk art making an appearance too!

Looking a bit further out, we are also hoping to participate in **Headwaters Day** ([link](https://www.breckenridgemn.net/headwaters-day))

This is a big city-wide event with lots of vendors, and we're planning to get involved! We'll have more details once we know for sure what will be going on, but this should be another chess event to look forward to.

I think that's all I know for now, but thanks for checking in! I'm on the hunt for new content to post here more regularly, so if you have any ideas, please reach out!
