Wow! We had some incredible games on display this month. A bunch of games which came down to the last few seconds, and so many intense positions!

We also had a fantastic turnout this previous weekend at Headwaters Day! Lots of people stopped by the booth to see what we're about, and we had quite a few challengers for Dominik, which raised a good amount of money for the club!

By the way, we did have a minor issue with the mailing list sign-up sheet at Headwaters Day, so if you signed up to be on the mailing list but haven't gotten an email from us yet, please email us at [breckwahpchess@gmail.com](mailto:breckwahpchess@gmail.com) so we can get you added.

Just as a reminder, Chess in the Park is back on after last weekend's brief intermission, resuming again this Saturday the 21st. This event runs 10a-1p every Saturday (weather permitting) at Chahinkapa Park, on one of the picnic benches between Hughes Shelter and the Band Shelter. Please feel free to stop by and check it out! Hopefully the weather stays nice enough to continue this event well into fall.

Thanks, everyone! See you next time!
